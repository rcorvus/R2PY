# R2PY
Raspberry Pi and Arduino code for controlling a three legged droid

This control system uses the Sabertooth and Syren hardware configuration from Padawan developed by DanK, DanF, et al. and the XboxController code developed by Martin O'Hanlon (which I upgraded to Python 3)

In order to get the Peekaboo system working, you'll need to configure OpenCV on your Raspberry Pi.  Here are [extremely good instructions](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/) on how to install everything you need, but even better if you buy his [Practical Python And OpenCV QuickStart bundle](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/practical-python-opencv/), he gives you a Raspberry Pi image file preconfigured with everything you need.  To me, that was worth $100 in time savings right there, and his tutorials are great too.

Let me know if you have any trouble with this system or if you have trouble submitting pull requests.

Enjoy!
